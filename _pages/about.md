Hello! My name is Panqu Wang (王泮渠). I am currently the Partner, Autonomous Driving at [ZERON 零一汽车](https://zeron.jobs.feishu.cn/campus/), leading the team to invent high-performance, strong-generalization, and cost-efficient L4 autonomous driving product. Prior to ZERON, I was the Director of Deep Perception at [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com/), creating efficient and effective perception system for L4 autonomous driving trucks.
                          
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in March, 2017 from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/). My advisor is [Professor Garrison W. Cottrell](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/gary/). My research areas are on perception and cognitive modeling. I build brain-inspired neurocomputational models that explain how face and objects are processed and recognized in human visual pathway. For the full publication list, please check my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z1CFfzwAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

I come from [Tianjin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin), China, and my lovely hometown is in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin) province. Heading south, I spent 4 years in [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), Shanghai, to get my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. During my senior year, I visited UCSD and joined [Professor Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/)'s lab doing projects on building a speed limit sign detector an Android phone.
